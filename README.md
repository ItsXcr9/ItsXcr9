# xcr9

I am **xcr9**.

A DevOps engineer and systems-focused builder who designs, operates, and questions infrastructure that runs in the real world — where failures happen, assumptions break, and systems are judged by how they behave under pressure.

This space represents my work, my experiments, and my engineering mindset.

## About me

I work at the intersection of:

- distributed systems  
- infrastructure and automation  
- Kubernetes and cloud-native platforms  
- observability, reliability, and failure analysis  

I am less interested in tools themselves and more interested in **why systems behave the way they do** when scale, latency, and human error collide.

## How I think

My approach to engineering is shaped by a few core beliefs:

- Production is the only honest environment  
- Simplicity is a feature, not a limitation  
- Automation is how systems remember  
- If a system is hard to operate, it is unfinished  

I prefer boring infrastructure that survives chaos over clever designs that collapse quietly.

## What you’ll find here

This repository and related projects may include:

- infrastructure patterns and real-world configurations  
- Kubernetes deployments and experiments  
- CI/CD pipelines and automation workflows  
- architectural notes and technical explorations  

Some projects are polished. Others are intentionally raw. Both are honest.

## Current focus

My current interests evolve, but often orbit around:

- making distributed systems observable and debuggable  
- reducing operational complexity at scale  
- designing infrastructure that is safe to change  
- learning from failure rather than hiding it

Most infrastructure problems are not technical failures.

They are failures of clarity.
