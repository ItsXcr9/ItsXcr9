# Xcr9

I am **Xcr9**.

A DevOps engineer and systems-focused builder who designs, operates, and questions infrastructure that runs in the real world — where failures happen, assumptions break, and systems are judged by how they behave under pressure.

This space represents my work, my experiments, and my engineering mindset.
